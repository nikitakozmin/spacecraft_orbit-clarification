DESCRIPTION                  = "Orbit Data Files (ODFs) are                   
    produced by the NASA/JPL Multi-Mission Navigation Radio                   
    Metric Data Conditioning Team for use in determining                      
    spacecraft trajectories, gravity fields affecting them,                   
    and radio propagation conditions.  Each ODF consists of                   
    many 36-byte logical records, which fall into 7 primary                   
    groups plus an End-of-File Group.  An ODF usually                         
    contains most groups, but may not have all.  The first                    
    record in each of the 7 primary groups is a header                        
    record; depending on the group, there may be from zero                    
    to many data records following each header.  The ODF is

     usually the fourth of several groups of records in an                    
     Orbit Data File (ODF).  They contain information on                      
     tuning of receivers or transmitters.  There is usually                   
     one Ramp Group for each DSN station.  The Ramp Group                     
     Header is the first record in each Ramp Group.  It is                    
     one 36-byte record and is followed by one or more 36-
